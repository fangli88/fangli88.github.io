This app allows you to experiment with creating and modifying CIMSymbol JSON that may be used to represent data in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. Select a symbol layer and change its properties using the UI elements of the app. After designing a symbol, you can copy the JSON to the clipboard and paste it into your app. Currently, the app only supports [CIMPointSymbol](https://github.com/Esri/cim-spec/blob/master/docs/v2/CIMSymbols.md#CIMPointSymbol)

You can add symbol layer(s) from the pre-defined symbols in symbol gallery or import in your own symbol or web style, thne edit the properties of each symbo layer. When you are finished editing, you can copy the symbol JSON to the clipboard and use it in your own app.
